        <div class="national-press">

            <p class="centered">The American national press represents a much more fragmented array of sources than television network news, and therefore, when considered as an entire medium, may have much more bredth in stories and pursued narratives. Oftentimes, individuals with strong identities in their political party will consume media that confirms rather than challenges the narratives embraced by their political party. As a result, the American press features a broad spectrum of political bias from extreme left to extreme right. To understand the media diet of individuals belonging to differing political parties, we examine two sets of content, one pulled from news sources that are most often tweeted by registered Democrats and one pulled from news sources that are most often tweeted by registered Republicans (note: the stories analyzed were not necessarily most tweeted by either group of individuals, we simply categorize the news sources by frequency of tweeting by each group).</p>

            <br>


            <p class="centered">The graphs below analyze stories published by two different sets of media outlets, media sources whose stories are most tweeted by registred Democrats (blue) and media sources whose stories are most tweeted by registered Republicans (red). We took all stories published by these two groups and cataloged how many stories per day included references of "Ukraine" (top graph) and how many stories per day included references of "Ukraine" with close mentions of "corrupt" or "corruption". Taking this subset of stories referencing "Ukraine", we then analyze which of the two groups contained a higher share of content referencing "Ukraine" on every day in 2023. The graph represents all published stories from these two groups of media outlets referencing "Ukraine" and then plots them against eachother depicting which set of outlets had a higher share of content referencing "Ukraine" in comparison to the other set of outlets.</p>

            <h3 class="centered" style="color:black">Key Takeaways</h3>
            
            <br>

            <li class="centered" style="line-height: 2">In 2023, both sets of media sources published roughly the same proportional amount of content referencing "Ukraine" with media sources most often tweeted by Republican voters publishing approximately 6% more than media sources most often tweeted by Democrat voters.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="centered" style="line-height: 2">In 2023, media sources most often tweeted by Republican voters published approximately 11% more content about Ukraine including close mentions of "corrupt" or "corruption" than media sources most often tweeted by Democrat voters. </li>

            <br><br>

            <div class="boxed centered">
                <h3>How to Interpret These Charts</h3>
                <li>The top chart measures frequency of usage of "Ukraine". The bottom chart measures frequency of usage of "corrupt" or "corruption" in stories that use "Ukraine".</li>
                <li>The chart plots the share of stories referencing "Ukraine" from each group against each other.</li>
                <li>The 50% line down the middle indicates an even split between the two groups. Therefore, if red is above the line, it indicates that group has a higher share of stories regarding Ukraine on that day compared to blue.</li>
                <li>If the graph were to be split with half red and half blue, it would indicate that each group published the same relative share of stories regarding Ukraine on that day.</li>
                <li>The graph does not measure absolute values, only relative ones. Therefore, if both groups published 3% of their stories about Ukraine on a given day, this would read as a 50/50 split. If both groups published 10% of their stories about Ukraine on a given day, this would also read as a 50/50 split.</li>

                <h3>How to interpret the Word Clouds below</h3>
                <li>The word clouds below visualize the frequency of use for each word mentioned within a three-minute timeframe of the term "Ukraine" being mentioned</li>
                <li>The visualization is based on the data collected over the year 2023 for the two major US-based TV networks: FoxNews and CNN</li>
                <li>The frequency of use is depicted by the size: the bigger a particular term in the cloud - the more frequently it was used in conjunction with the term "Ukraine"</li>
                <li>Similarly, the smaller a particular term in the cloud - the less frequently it was used in conjunction with the term "Ukraine"</li>

            </div>

            <br><br>

            <h3 class="centered" style="color:black">Key Takeaways</h3>

            <br>
            <li class="centered" style="line-height: 2">In 2023, both FoxNews and CNN used the terms "Biden" and "Russia" with similar frequency.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="centered" style="line-height: 2">FoxNews frequently covered Ukraine in conjunction with Israel. It often brough border protection issues into the discussion surrounding Ukraine, as well as Hunter Biden, military, and security. This news source also covered Russia's nuclear threats a lot more extensively than CNN.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="centered" style="line-height: 2">Unlike FoxNews, CNN didn't shy away from the term "war" and mentioned Putin a lot more frequently. It tended to cover Ukraine in conjunction with Israel less often, focusing more on Wagner group and China.</li>
